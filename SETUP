 Compiling locally
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To compile locally, first create a symlink to a junit 4.x jar by the
 name of "junit.jar". Oasis IDE uses JUnit for running unit tests 
 against the build. It's a good idea to make sure you didn't break any
 before you commit. Once you've created the symlink, you should be able
 to compile through ant by running "ant compile".

 If you need any additional help, we will try to keep OasisIDE.com 
 updated with information on the current project maintainers.
